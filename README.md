## How can the project be used? 

It is a placeholder and backup for selected content by bible book categories. A bunch of content is not yet backed up to the repo as it needs spell checking, grammar checking. If any content is present, it may be in development.

## VBVMI investigation

Verse by verse ministry international (VBVMI) already supplied some material on the net. Reformatting VBVMI content to XML was being investigated. Software that could read the XML like JavaScript might improve the efficiency of the printouts by using the page more of the page and also allow grouping and sort records. Some people are not into computer devices and this is what caused paper printing to be the first purpose.

Beyond the printout, any software might eventually help download videos in a bunch of links automatically in a software instead of doing it manually one at a time.
