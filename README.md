## How can the project be used? 

It is a placeholder and backup for selected content by bible book categories. A bunch of content is not yet backed up to the repo as it needs spell checking, grammar checking. If any content is present, it may be in development.

## VBVMI investigation

Verse by verse ministry international (VBVMI) already supplied some material on the net. Reformatting VBVMI content to XML was being investigated. Software that could read the XML like JavaScript might improve the efficiency of the printouts by using the page more of the page and also allow grouping and sort records. Some people are not into computer devices and this is what caused paper printing to be the first purpose.

Beyond the printout, any software might eventually help download videos in a bunch of links automatically in a software instead of doing it manually one at a time.

## Limitations / obstacles during VBVMI investigation.

Sermons and bible teachings are mostly for people and only need the computer to run a video player. People watching a sermon audio / video do not require the latest technologies or security. However, programmers going with technologies and security plans might have code that endures longer in the future, assuming the less preferred languages will eventually go obsolete. So programming issues may exist ...

* Some JavaScript (ECMAScript) was used to make an index of media files, but no guidance for JavaScript was observed in reference 1a. Reference 1b might have encouraged putting some guidance, but there is not expertise to know that for sure. What is current or how GAO had intended wasn't certain. It may not be practical to wait for additional actions (guidance) about JavaScript programming. As there is time, JavaScript programming may continue without being able to rely on guidance from reference 1a.

* Reformatting the indices of sermons to XML data files involved repetitive text processing for which some automation help was desirable to reduce manual effort. One legacy tool for text processing was 'AWK'. It was not the only tool as there was sed, but AWK was understood to be newer than sed. The AWK tool was not memory safe since it has 43% C language according to a [website](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gawk.git/tree/). Reference 1c goals for open source software (OSS) could not be interpreted without knowing the author's exact intent. It would be nice if it meant OSS goals would deliver a newer memory safe AWK tool. Either a delivery was not known or waiting for something that might not happen would not be the best choice. As there is time, new rudimentary programming in swift may be attempted to do the text processing.
