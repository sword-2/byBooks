## How can the project be used? 

It is a placeholder and backup for selected content by bible book categories. A bunch of content is not yet backed up to the repo as it needs spell checking, grammar checking. If any content is present, it may be in development.

## VBVMI investigation

Verse by verse ministry international (VBVMI) already supplied some material on the net. Reformatting VBVMI content to XML was being investigated. Software that could read the XML like JavaScript might improve the efficiency of the printouts by using the page more of the page and also allow grouping and sort records. Some people are not into computer devices and this is what caused paper printing to be the first purpose.

Beyond the printout, any software might eventually help download videos in a bunch of links automatically in a software instead of doing it manually one at a time.

## Limitations / obstacles during VBVMI investigation.

Sermons and bible teachings are mostly for people and only need the computer to run a video player. They do not require the latest technologies or security. However, programmers going with technologies and security plans might have code that endures longer in the future assuming the less preferred languages will eventually go obsolete. The future isn't known, but trends were considered..

* Some JavaScript (ECMAScript) was used to make an index of media files, but no guidance for JavaScript was observed in reference 1a. Reference 1b might have encouraged putting some guidance to help others, but there is not expertise to know that for sure. What is current or how GAO applies the reports can't be known. The result is that effort in JavaScript programming was continued without expecting or waiting for any additional actions on JavaScript.

* Reformatting the indices of sermons to XML data files involved repetitive text processing for which some automation help was desirable. One legacy tool for text processing was 'AWK', however this tool was not memory safe since it has 43% C language according to a [website](https://github.com/onedtrueawk/awk). Again, typical people in the public could not know if reference 1c was current for open source software (OSS) production or if it could be interpreted as a memory safe AWK tool. In all the uncertainty, some rudimentary swift code might be written for text processing instead of AWK. This may increase time to complete.
